    "The datasets were created by `Nicolas Carbone`. The datasets were sourced from kaggle's 200+ Financial Indicators of US stocks (2014-2018), and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018), particularly this [file](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018/download).\n",

    "Each dataset contains 200+ financial indicators, which are usually found in 10-K filings of publicly traded company yearly releases. There are some missing values in this dataset. Each row in each dataset represents a set of observations of different companies and each column represents a feature of the stock's future performance. These datasets can be used for a classification task, whereby if the value of the `PRICE VAR [%]` column is positive, the last column `class` = 1, which signifies that a hypothetical investor should BUY the stock at the start of the year and sell at the end of the year for a profit. Whilst, if the value of the `PRICE VAR [%]` column is negative, the column `class` = 0, which signifies that a hypothetical investor should NOT BUY the stock because its value will decrease by the end of the year. \n",
